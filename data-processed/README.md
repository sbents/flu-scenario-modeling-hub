# Data submission instructions

This page is intended to provide teams with all the information they need to submit scenarios.  

All scenarios should be submitted directly to the [data-processed/](./) folder.
Data in this directory should be added to the repository through a pull request. 

Due to file size limitation, the file can be submitted in a `.zip` or `.gz` format with the same name as the `.csv` file provided. 

All submissions will be validated, for more information please consult
the validation wiki page. The automatic validation process is currently in construction, until ready the submission will be manually validated.

## Example

See [this file](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/2022-08-14_MyTeam-MyModel.csv) and [this metadata file](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/metadata-MyTeam-MyModel.txt) for an illustration of part of a (hypothetical) submission files.
An example of the “sample” format file submission is also available [here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/MyTeam-MyModel/2022-08-14-MyTeam-MyModel-sample.csv).


## Subdirectory

Each subdirectory within the [data-processed/](./) directory has the format:

    team-model
    
where 

- `team` is the teamname and 
- `model` is the name of your model. 

Both team and model should be less than 15 characters, and not include hyphens nor spaces.

Within each subdirectory, there should be a metadata file, a license file (optional), and a set of scenarios. 

## Metadata 

The metadata file name should have the following format

    metadata-team-model.txt
    
where 

- `team` is the teamname and 
- `model` is the name of your model. 
    
Here are details about [the structure of the metadata file](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/master/data-processed/METADATA.md). An example hypothetical metadata file has been posted in the `data-processed` directory. 

## License (optional)

License information for data sharing and reuse is requested in the metadata, including a link to the license text. If you cannot link to the text of a standard license and have specific license text, include a license file named

    LICENSE.txt

## Model Results

Each model results file within the subdirectory should have the following name

    YYYY-MM-DD-team-model-type.csv
    
where

- `YYYY` is the 4 digit year,
- `MM` is the 2 digit month,
- `DD` is the 2 digit day,
- `team` is the teamname, and
- `model` is the name of your model.
- `type` is only for the optional submission format for simulation samples (`“YYYY-MM-DD-team-model-sample.csv”`). Other submission file formats (quantiles) should be named `“YYYY-MM-DD-team-model.csv”`.

The date YYYY-MM-DD is the [`model_projection_date`](#model_projection_date).

The `team` and `model` in this file must match the `team` and `model` in the directory this file is in. 
Both `team` and `model` should be less than 15 characters, alpha-numeric and underscores only, with no spaces or hyphens.


## Model results file format

The file must be a comma-separated value (csv) file with the following 
columns (in any order):

- `model_projection_date`
- `scenario_name`
- `scenario_id`
- `target`
- `target_end_date`
- `location`
- `type` [not required for “sample” file format]
- `quantile` [not required for “sample” file format]
- `sample` [required for “sample” file format]
- `value`
- `age_group`

No additional columns are allowed.

Each row in the file is either a point or quantile scenario for a location on a particular date for a particular target.

If the size of the file is larger than 100MB, it can be submitted in a `.zip` or `.gz` format.


### `model_projection_date`

Values in the `model_projection_date` column must be a date in the format

    YYYY-MM-DD
    
Model projections will have an associated `model_projection_date` that corresponds to the day the projection was made.    

For week-ahead model projections with `model_projection_date` of Sunday or Monday of EW12, a 1 week ahead projection corresponds to EW12 and should have `target_end_date` of the Saturday of EW12. For week-ahead projections with `model_projection_date` of Tuesday through Saturday of EW12, a 1 week ahead projection corresponds to EW13 and should have `target_end_date` of the Saturday of EW13. A week-ahead projection should represent the total number of incident deaths or hospitalizations within a given epiweek (from Sunday through Saturday, inclusive) or the cumulative number of deaths reported on the Saturday of a given epiweek. Model projection dates in the Flu Scenario Modeling Hub are equivelent to the forecast dates in the [COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.org/). 

### `scenario_name`

The standard scenario names should be used as given in the scenario description in the [main Readme](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub). Scenario names only include characters and no spaces, e.g., `lowVac_optImm`.


### `scenario_id`

The standard scenario id should be used as given in in the scenario description in the [main Readme](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub). Scenario id's include a captitalized letter and date as YYYY-MM-DD on which the scenario was last modified by the project coordinators, e.g., `A-2022-08-14`.


### `target`

We are requesting model projections for 42 weeks into the future.

The requested targets are:
- weekly incident deaths (US level only)
- weekly cumulative deaths (US level only)
- weekly incident hospitalizations (US + State level)
- weekly cumulative hospitalizations (US + State level)
- peak size hospitalizations (US + State level)
- weekly peak timing hospitalizations (US + State level)

The cumulative and peak targets are not required in the “sample” file format and should not be included in the "sample" submission files.

Values in the `target` column must be a character (string) and be one of the following specific targets:

- "N wk ahead inc death"  where N is a number between 1 and 42
- "N wk ahead cum death"  where N is a number between 1 and 42
- "N wk ahead inc hosp"  where N is a number between 1 and 42
- "N wk ahead cum hosp"  where N is a number between 1 and 42
- "peak size hosp"  
- "N wk ahead peak time hosp"  where N is a number between 1 and 42

For week-ahead scenarios, we will use the specification of epidemiological weeks (EWs) defined by the US CDC which run Sunday through Saturday.

There are standard software packages to convert from dates to epidemic weeks and vice versa. E.g. [MMWRweek](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MMWRweek/) for R and [pymmwr](https://pypi.org/project/pymmwr/) and [epiweeks](https://pypi.org/project/epiweeks/) for python.

For week-ahead scenarios with `model_projection_date` of Sunday or Monday of EW12,a 1 week ahead scenario corresponds to EW12 and should have `target_end_date` of the Saturday of EW12. For week-ahead scenarios with `model_projection_date` of Tuesday through Saturday of EW12, a 1 week ahead scenario corresponds to EW13 and should have `target_end_date` of the Saturday of EW13.


#### N wk ahead inc death

This target is the national incident (weekly) number of deaths predicted by the model during the week that is N weeks after `model_projection_date`. There should not be any death projections at the state level. 

A week-ahead scenario should represent the total number of new deaths
reported during a given epiweek (from Sunday through Saturday, inclusive).

Predictions for this target will be evaluated compared to the number of new deaths derived from the CDC multiplier model, which inflates flu deaths reported in the hospital by a factor accounting for underreporting and out-of-hospital mortality.These estimates are published in real time starting a few weeks into the influenza season.  


#### N wk ahead cum death

This target is the national cumulative number of deaths predicted by the model up to and including N weeks after `model_projection_date`. There should be 0 cumulative deaths on week 0 of projection.

A week-ahead scenario should represent the cumulative number of deaths reported on the Saturday of a given epiweek.

Predictions for this target will be evaluated compared to the number of cumulative deaths derived from the CDC multiplier model, which inflates flu deaths reported in the hospital by a factor accounting for underreporting and out-of-hospital mortality.These estimates are published in real time starting a few weeks into the influenza season.


#### N wk ahead inc hosp

This target is the incident (weekly) number of hospitalized cases predicted by the model during the week that is N weeks after `model_projection_date`.

A week-ahead scenario should represent the total number of new hospitalized cases reported during a given epiweek (from Sunday through Saturday, inclusive).

Predictions for this target will be evaluated against the weekly number of new hospitalized cases, as recorded by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Flu and COVID-19 system (derived from the prior day influenza admissions variable). 


#### N wk ahead cum hosp

This target is the cumulative number of incident (weekly) number of hospitalized cases predicted by the model during the week that is N weeks after `model_projection_date`.

A week-ahead scenario should represent the cumulative number of hospitalized cases reported up to the Saturday of a given epiweek.

Predictions for this target will be evaluated against the cumulative number of hospitalized cases since the start of the projection period, as recorded by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Flu and COVID-19 system (derived from the prior day influenza admissions variable)


#### N wk ahead peak time hosp

This target is the cumulative probability of the incident hospitalization peak occurring that week  predicted by the model during the week that is N weeks after `model_projection_date`.

Further, we do not expect a full distribution of quantiles, only “point” values for this target.

Predictions for this target will be evaluated against the week of the peak number of hospitalized cases in 2022-23, as recorded by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Flu and COVID-19 system (derived from the prior day influenza admissions variable).


#### peak size hosp

This target is the magnitude of the peak of weekly incident hospitalizations in the model, when considering the full projection period. 

Further, we do not expect a full time series, the `target_end_date` column associated with this value should be set to `NA`.

Predictions for this target will be evaluated against the size of the peak number of weekly hospitalized cases in 2022-23, as recorded by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services Flu and COVID-19 system(derived from the prior day influenza admissions variable).


### `target_end_date`

Values in the `target_end_date` column must be a date in the format

    YYYY-MM-DD
    
This is the date for the scenario `target`. 
For "# wk" targets, `target_end_date` will be the Saturday at the end of the week time period.


### `location`

Values in the `location` column must be one of the "locations" in this [FIPS numeric code file](../data-locations/locations.csv) which includes numeric FIPS codes for U.S. states, counties, territories, and districts as well as "US" for national scenarios. 

Please note that when writing FIPS codes, they should be written in as a character string to preserve any leading zeroes.


### `type`

Values in the `type` column are either

- "point" or
- "quantile".

This value indicates whether that row corresponds to a point scenario or a quantile scenario.
Point scenarios are used in visualization while quantile scenarios are used in visualization and in ensemble construction. 

The "point" value for the `"cum death"`, `"inc death"`, `"cum hosp"`, `"inc hosp"` and `"peak size hosp"` targets is optional. If no "point" values are provided, the quantiles values will be used for visualization


### `quantile`

Values in the `quantile` column are either "NA" (if `type` is "point") or a quantile in the format

    0.###
    
For quantile scenarios, this value indicates the quantile for the `value` in this row. 

Teams should provide the following 23 quantiles:

```r
c(0.01, 0.025, seq(0.05, 0.95, by = 0.05), 0.975, 0.99)
```

```
##  [1] 0.010 0.025 0.050 0.100 0.150 0.200 0.250 0.300 0.350 0.400 0.450 0.500 0.550 0.600 0.650 0.700 0.750
## [18] 0.800 0.850 0.900 0.950 0.975 0.990
```

Teams are also encouraged to submit `0` (min value) and `1` (max) quantiles if possible

### `sample`

For the optional simulation samples format only.
Values in the `sample` column are numeric between `1` and `100` indicating an id sample number.


### `value`

Values in the `value` column are non-negative numbers indicating the "point" or "quantile" prediction for this row. 
For a "point" prediction, `value` is simply the value of that point prediction for the `target` and `location` associated with that row. 
For a "quantile" prediction, `value` is the inverse of the cumulative 
distribution function (CDF) for the `target`, `location`, and `quantile` associated with that row.

#### Peak time hosp

For the `peak time hosp` target, the values in the `value` column are non-negative numbers between 0 and 1.  


### `age_group ` (optional)

Values in the  `age_group` column are:

- "0-4"
- "5-17"
- "18-49"
- "50-64"
- "65-130"

Or any aggregation of the previous list, for example: "0-17". 
If the submissions files contain projections for the overall population, please use `0-130` as age-group. 

For the `peak` targets, only the age-group `0-130` is required.

## Scenario validation

To ensure proper data formatting, validation on the pull requests for new data in data-processed/ will be run.

For the first round of submissions, the automated pull requests may not work yet. In this case, a manual validation will be run and the output will be posted as message in the Pull-request.  

The intent for these tests are to validate the requirements above and 
specifically enumerated [on the wiki](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/wiki/Scenario-File-Checks) (in construction).
Please [let us know](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/issues) if the wiki is inaccurate.
