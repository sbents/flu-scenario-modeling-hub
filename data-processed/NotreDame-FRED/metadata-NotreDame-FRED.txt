methods: FRED is an agent-based model developed for influenza. We have calibrated the model parameters to reproduce previous influenza seasons, using targets for hospitalizations, deaths, and infection attack rate. To update for round 3, we used data available for the current incidence of hospitalizations to fit the model.
