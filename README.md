# Flu Scenario Modeling Hub

Last updated: 12-5-2022 for **Round 3 Scenarios**.

## Rationale    

Even the best models of infectious disease transmission struggle to give 
accurate forecasts at time scales greater than 3-4 weeks due to unpredictable 
drivers like changing policy environments, behavior change, development of new 
control measures, and stochastic events. However, policy decisions around the 
course of infectious diseases, particularly emerging and seasonal infections, 
often require projections in the time frame of months. The goal of long-term 
projections is to compare outbreak trajectories under different scenarios, as 
opposed to offering a specific, unconditional estimate of what “will” happen. 
As such, long-term projections can guide longer-term decision-making while 
short-term forecasts are more useful for situational awareness and guiding 
immediate response.

We have specified a set of scenarios and target outcomes to allow alignment of 
model projections for collective insights. Scenarios have been designed in 
consultation with academic modeling teams and government agencies (e.g., CDC).

</br>

## How to participate    

The Flu Scenario Modeling Hub is open to any team willing to provide projections
at the right temporal and spatial scales, with minimal gatekeeping. We only 
require that participating teams share point estimates and uncertainty bounds, 
along with a short model description and answers to a list of key questions 
about design. A major output of the projection hub is ensemble estimates of 
epidemic outcomes (e.g., infection, hospitalizations, and deaths), for different
time points, intervention scenarios, and US jurisdictions.

Those interested to participate, please read the README file and email us at scenariohub@midasnetwork.us .

Model projections should be submitted via pull request to the data-processed 
folder of this GitHub repository. Technical instructions for submission and 
required file formats can be found 
[here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/README.md).

## Round 3 Scenarios     

Round 3 is a direct update of Round 2 with 3 extra weeks of data. 
We will consider the interaction of vaccination effectiveness 
(first dimension) with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 
prior immunity to influenza (second dimension) over a 26-week 
period (Dec 4, 2022 - June 3, 2023). We follow the usual 2 * 2 
table structure.

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/main/flu_round3.png">


In all scenarios, we assume that vaccine uptake will proceed at the same pace 
as in the **2021-22 season** by state and age group.


### **OTHER SPECIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS**

**Prior Immunity***

*   This follows exactly the same specifications as in Round 1

*   Prior influenza immunity is assumed to be a combination of residual 
immunity from previous infections and previous seasonal vaccinations. The 
exact specifications of prior immunity is left at the discretion of each 
team, and will depend on model specification, but we provide suggestions below. 

*   At the onset of a typical influenza season (all subtypes combined), 
modeling has been estimated that around 30-35% of the population has prior 
immunity (65-70% susceptible), the effective reproduction number ranges from 
1.2-1.4, and the attack rate (final size) is between 8-25% 
https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1415012112. The 2009 pandemic, which 
was marked by the emergence of a new strain to which individuals under the 
age of 50 yrs were susceptible, was associated with greater transmission 
(cumulative attack rates 32% over 2009) and decreased prior immunity compared 
to a regular season (prior immunity in 2009 is ~25% instead of ~33%).

*   Scenarios A and C (optimistic prior immunity) are meant to project the 
impact of a regular influenza season, with the same average immunity conditions 
as pre COVID19.

*   Scenarios B and D (pessimistic prior immunity) are meant to project the 
impact of a high-transmission influenza season, driven by the immunity gap left 
by two years of low influenza circulation. We expect that the immunity gap is 
primarily driven by loss of immunity from natural infection. Flu vaccination 
has proceeded as usual throughout the pandemic, but vaccine-derived immunity 
is short lasting. In scenarios B and D, the total proportion of immune 
individuals at the start of the season (no matter where immunity comes from) 
should be half (X0.5) of that assumed in scenarios A and C. For instance if 
prior immunity is 33% in scenarios A and C, it should be 16.5% in scenarios B 
and D.

*   Teams are allowed to vary prior immunity by virus subtype, age or other demographic 
characteristic, as long as the overall matches the scenario specifications.


**COVID-19 Interactions**

*   No major interactions with future COVID-19 surges (immunological, social, behavior) in this round. We may consider interactions in the next update.

**Influenza strains**

*   Hospitalization and death targets include the impact of all influenza subtypes 
combined. However, influenza A/H3N2 is presumed to dominate in the coming season 
(H3N2 dominance is defined as  >75% of all influenza viruses being categorized 
as H3N2 cumulatively at the end of the season). Throughout October 2022, 82% of 
circulating viruses were A/H3N2, 16% A/H1N1, 2% of B. Weekly surveillance 
updates can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm).

*   Subtype-specific models are allowed
    *   Immunity conditions should be applied to all subtypes/strains that 
    aggregates to the overall conditions specified in the scenarios

*   Intrinsic transmissibility (R0): We assume the intrinsic transmissibility 
of H3N2 is same as that of H3N2 in the 2021-2022 season (or that of H3N2 seasons 
prior to COVID19). In other words, the only changes in effective transmission of 
H3N2 between years come from differences in prior immunity and social mixing.

**Vaccine Effectiveness**

*   We assume that VE against hospitalizations and medical illnesses is the same. 
We index high VE [(overall estimate 50%)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/effectiveness-studies.htm)
on the 2015-16 season and low VE [(overall estimate 30%)](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/2018-2019.htm) 
on the 2018-2019 season. 

*   Teams should use the following data  to scale VE to different age groups and 
strains/subtypes. We recommend considering age-specific differences.
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/2018-2019.html (2018-2019 low VE season)
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28792867/ (2015-2016 high VE season). These prior 
estimates should be considered as directly applicable to the 2022-23 season, 
even though the mix of circulating subtypes may differ.

*   [A study from Chile](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7143a1.htm?s_cid=mm7143a1_x) 
has reported a VE of  49% (95% CI = 23%–67%) against H3N2 hospitalizations during 
their 2022 season. The A/H3N2 vaccine strain was A/Darwin/9/2021 and matched the 
circulating H3N2 variant (clade 3C.2a1b.2a2). In the US, we would expect a similarly 
well-matched vaccine this season. However, since the study is relatively small, 
confidence intervals are broad, and we have not seen a VE of ~50% for A/H3N2 in 
recent years, we have kept high and low values of VE as a scenario axis.  


**Vaccine immune waning**

*   Vaccine-induced immunity has been found to decrease rapidly over the course of an 
influenza season https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/64/5/544/2758477?login=true

**Age groups**

*   Age-stratification is optional. If stratified, immunity and vaccination 
should aggregate to specifications in scenarios
*   Suggested age-strata:
    *   0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ (or some aggregation of this, like 18-64, etc.). 
    Most of the burden on hospitalization and deaths come from the 0-4 and 65+ age groups.


### **Targets and Time Horizon:**

**Projection time horizon:** We consider a **26-week projection period:**

*    *December 4, 2022* to *June 3, 2023*

**Targets:** 

*   **Weekly target**
    *   Weekly <u>reported</u> state-level incident and cumulative hospitalizations, based on 
    HHS COVID and flu [reporting system](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). This dataset is updated daily and covers 2020-2022. Weekly 
    hospitalizations should be based on the “previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed” 
    variable, without any adjustment for reporting (=raw data from HHS dataset 
    to be projected). A current version of the weekly aggregated data has [been posted here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd1_datasets/HHS_flu_2020_2022_dataset.csv).
    *   Weekly national incident deaths, from the CDC multiplier model. These are 
    real-time model estimates updated weekly during the influenza season.  The model 
    relies on influenza deaths reported in the hospitals via the flusurvnet system, 
    adjusted for under testing of flu in the hospital and the proportion of deaths 
    occurring outside of the hospital. There is no state detail. Between October 
    1-November 26, 2022, it is estimated that 4,500 – 13,000 deaths were due to flu 
    illness or flu-related complications based on the CDC model. We have provided 3 
    historical seasons of weekly death estimates [for calibration](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd1_datasets/In-season-National-Burden.csv). Further, see here for 
    real-time cumulative estimates, and summary estimates for past seasons. A file of 
    weekly cumulative estimates for the 2022-23 season is posted [here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/CumulativeDeath/In_season_CDC_burden_estimates_deaths.csv).
    * No case target
    * No infection target   
    * All targets should be numbers of individuals, rather than rates.

*   **Seasonal target**
    * State-level peak hospitalizations.
    * State-level timing of peak hospitalizations.
    * Note that cumulative deaths and cumulative hospitalizations at the end 
    of the projection period/season will also be used as seasonal targets. 
    These quantities are already listed under weekly targets (=cumulative 
    weekly outcomes on the last week of projections).

All cumulative outcomes start at 0 at the start of projections, on 
Dec 4, 2022. This is similar to round 1 and 2. To facilitate comparison between our 
cumulative projections and CDC’s burden estimates, the coordination team will add 
CDC’s death estimates for the 9 weeks between Oct 2 and Dec 4 (weeks 40-48 of 2022)
to the teams’ cumulative projections. This will be done as post-processing and 
these “full season estimates” will be displayed on the website and communicated 
to the public.


**State-level variability**

*   Vaccination coverage, age population 
*   Variability in severity between states is possible
*   It is acceptable to assume prior immunity (due to a combination of 
vaccination and natural infection) the same across states; variability 
between states is allowed as long as it aggregates to the scenario definition 
for the US overall (population weighted average)


**Cross-protection of subtype immunity:** At the discretion of the teams.

**Influenza vaccine coverage data:** Projected week and state-level coverage to use 
in scenarios A-D are provided [here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd2_datasets/Age_Specific_Coverage_Flu_RD2_2022_23_Sc_A_B_C_D.csv) for various age groups: 
0-4yr, 5-12yr, 13-17yr, 0-17yr, 18-49yr, 50-64yr, 65+yr. These are based on vaccination 
rates reported in 2021-22; estimates can be used as is without further adjustment.

**Seasonality:** Teams should include their best estimates of influenza seasonality 
in their model but we do not prescribe a specific level of seasonal forcing.

**NPI:** No reactive NPIs to COVID-19 or influenza; low level masking allowed at 
groups’ discretion.

**Seeding of influenza:** As influenza is already circulating in the US, we leave 
seeding intensity, timing and geographic distribution at the discretion of the 
teams. In addition to the HHS hospital dataset, the [flu portal dashboard](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html) is a good 
resource for state-specific information on strain circulation and epidemic intensity 
(eg, weekly % positive, or weekly ILI\*%positive), and can be used to adjust seeding.

**Initial Conditions:**  The mix of circulating strains at the start of the 
projection period is at the discretion of the teams based on their 
interpretation/analysis of the available data and estimates at the time of 
projection. Variation in initial prevalence between states is left at teams’ discretion. 
See the [flu portal dashboard](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html).
 
**All of the teams’ specific assumptions should be documented in metadata and 
abstract.**

**Other submission requirements**

*   **Geographic scope:** state-level and national projections
    *    All states not required, US overall recommended.
*   **Results:**
    *  Summary: Results must consist of a subset of weekly and/or summary 
    targets listed below; all are not required. Weeks follow epi-weeks (Sun-Sat)
    dated by the last day of the week.
    *  **Weekly Targets** (subset of: hospitalizations, deaths)
        *    Weekly incident 
        *    Weekly cumulative since start of season (December 4, 2022)
    *  **Summary Targets** (hospitalizations)
        *    Peak size
        *    Peak timing 
*   **Metadata:** We will require a brief meta-data form, from all teams.
*   **Uncertainty:** We ask for 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, every 5% to 0.95, 0.975, and 
0.99. Teams are also encouraged to submit 0 (min value) and 1 (max) quantiles 
if possible. At present time, *inclusion in ensemble models requires a full set 
of quantiles from 0.01 to 0.99.*
*    **Simulation sample:** We ask that teams submit a sample of up to 100 
simulation replicates. Simulations should be sampled in such a way that they 
will be most likely to produce the same summary statistics as that quantile 
submitted. For some models, this may mean a random sample of simulations, for 
others with larger numbers of simulations, it may require weighted sampling.

## More details on target:

### Hospital target:

*   We use the [HHS COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). The target to be 
projected is confirmed influenza hospital admissions, reported as 
*previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed*. Therefore, before aggregating to 
the weekly values, the gold standard or “truth” data will shift the values in the 
date column one day earlier so that the date aligns with the date of admission. As 
an example, if 17 confirmed influenza hospital admissions were reported in the 
`previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed` field in a row where the `date field` 
was 2021-10-30, then the “truth” dataset would assign those 17 hospital admissions 
to a date of 2021-10-29. These cases would then be counted towards the weekly total computed for EW43, which runs from 2021-10-24 through 2021-10-30.
*   Influenza admission reporting became mandatory in this dataset on Feb-02-2021,
 and should continue to be mandatory for the duration of the summer and into the 
 next flu season. Accordingly, more than 41,000 US hospitals are reporting flu on 
 a weekly basis and no adjustment for reporting changes should be made. However the 
 data before Feb-02-2021 should be treated with caution.
*   Unlike flu admissions, flu deaths are no longer mandatory to report in this system 
and hence a different source of data will be used for deaths.
*   There is no age breakdown for flu in this HHS dataset. If teams need age-specific 
hospitalization data for calibration, or a longer dataset, they can apply the age 
distribution of flu hospitalizations available in [Flusurv-NET](https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) 
to the all-age HHS rate. Flusurv-NET is CDC’s parallel and long-running hospitalization 
surveillance system, which is based on a smaller set of US hospitals (9%). We have provided 
state-specific time [series here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd1_datasets/Flusurvnet_2003_2022_dataset.csv) (2003-present). Because Flusurv-NET data is not 
available for all states, we recommend that teams use the national age distribution of 
hospitalizations estimated in Flusurv-NET and apply it to national and state-specific 
HHS data. Adjustment for demographic differences between states can be considered, but 
are not required.
*   Earlier analyses have shown that estimates of influenza incidences are consistent 
between the HHS and CDC hospital surveillance systems in areas where both systems 
overlap. The flusurvnet data estimates ~15% fewer hospitalizations nationally 
than the HHS system based on 2021-22 data; however these differences may vary during 
the 2022-23 season.

## Submitting model projections

Groups interested in participating can submit model projections for each 
scenario in a CSV file formatted according to our specifications, and a metadata
file with a description of model information. See 
[here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/README.md) 
for technical submission requirements. Groups can submit their contributions as 
often as they want; the date of when a model projection was made (projection 
date) is recorded in the model submission file.   

### Gold standard data

For Flu hospitalizations, we use the [HHS COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/qqte-vkut). The target to be projected is confirmed influenza hospital admissions, reported as `"previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed"`. Therefore, before aggregating to the weekly values, the gold standard or “truth” data will shift the values in the date column one day earlier so that the date aligns with the date of admission. As an example, if 17 confirmed influenza hospital admissions were reported in the `"previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed"` field in a row where the `date field` was 2021-10-30, then the “truth” dataset would assign those 17 hospital admissions to a date of 2021-10-29. These cases would then be counted towards the weekly total computed for EW43, which runs from 2021-10-24 through 2021-10-30.

For Flu death, we use weekly estimates of cumulative influenza-related deaths based on CDC multiplier model, the data are available in the [flu-scenario-modeling-resources](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources) GitHub repository in the [CumulativeDeath](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/tree/main/CumulativeDeath) folder. The model is based on in-hospital deaths reported to flusurvnet and accounts for lack of influenza testing in the hospital, and deaths occurring outside of the hospital system. Estimates provided in this file are the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles (95% uncertainty interval). 

## Ensemble model
We aim to combine model projections into an ensemble.

## Data license and reuse
