# Flu Scenario Modeling Hub

Last updated: 14-08-2023 for **Round 4 Scenarios**.

## Rationale    

Even the best models of infectious disease transmission struggle to give 
accurate forecasts at time scales greater than 3-4 weeks due to unpredictable 
drivers like changing policy environments, behavior change, development of new 
control measures, and stochastic events. However, policy decisions around the 
course of infectious diseases, particularly emerging and seasonal infections, 
often require projections in the time frame of months. The goal of long-term 
projections is to compare outbreak trajectories under different scenarios, as 
opposed to offering a specific, unconditional estimate of what “will” happen. 
As such, long-term projections can guide longer-term decision-making while 
short-term forecasts are more useful for situational awareness and guiding 
immediate response.

We have specified a set of scenarios and target outcomes to allow alignment of 
model projections for collective insights. Scenarios have been designed in 
consultation with academic modeling teams and government agencies (e.g., CDC).

</br>

## How to participate    

The Flu Scenario Modeling Hub is open to any team willing to provide projections
at the right temporal and spatial scales, with minimal gatekeeping. We only 
require that participating teams share point estimates and uncertainty bounds, 
along with a short model description and answers to a list of key questions 
about design. A major output of the projection hub is ensemble estimates of 
epidemic outcomes (e.g., infection, hospitalizations, and deaths), for different
time points, intervention scenarios, and US jurisdictions.

Those interested to participate, please read the README file and email us at scenariohub@midasnetwork.us .

Model projections should be submitted via pull request to the data-processed 
folder of this GitHub repository. Technical instructions for submission and 
required file formats can be found 
[here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/README.md).

## Round 4 Scenarios     

Round 4 will provide early season projections for the 2023-24 influenza season 
and resemble what we did last year in Round 1 at a time when flu activity was 
low. This year however, we have an extra year of HHS Protect hospitalization 
data for calibration. We will consider 6 scenarios describing the interaction 
of vaccination coverage (first dimension) with the dominant influenza A subtype 
(second dimension) over a 39-week period, running Sun Sep 3, 2023 to Sat June 
1, 2024. We follow a 3 * 2 structure: 

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/main/previous-rounds/flu_round4.png">

**Assumptions regarding influenza subtype dominance, severity and age dynamics:** 
We will index the age dynamics and severity of the next flu season based on two 
recent exemplar seasons dominated by A/H3N3 (2017-18) and A/H1N1 (2019-20). The 
timing of the projected 2023-24 season could vary and shouldn’t be purely based 
on the dynamics of the exemplar seasons. In other words, teams can project early 
epidemics if model assumptions lead to that, for instance because of prior 
immunity, seeding or contact assumptions. The burden and age distribution of 
disease is what we’re after with these illustrative past seasons. 


1. The three scenarios assuming A/H3N2 dominance (A, C, E) are based on 
epidemiologic patterns observed during the **2017-2018** season. Teams should 
use data from this season (including but not limited to ILI, % positive for 
influenza, FluSurv-NET hospitalizations) to estimate Re at the start of the season 
and the % of hospitalizations in the different age groups. Around 65% of observed 
hospitalizations were among seniors and 6% were in children. 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm 


2. The three scenarios assuming A/H1N1 dominance (B, D, F) are based on the 
**2019-2020 season**. Similarly, the overall burden and % of hospitalizations in 
the different age groups should be based on data from this season. During the 
2019-20 epidemic, around 40% of observed hospitalizations were among seniors and 
around 15% of hospitalizations were observed in children.  We will ignore the 
potential effect of COVID-19 at the very tail end of the 2019-20 season.  
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html 


Note that both exemplar seasons had some amount of influenza B activity, which c
an be ignored (ie, accounting for influenza B activity is at teams’ discretion).

Age-specific data on estimated illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths are provided 
here for the 2017-18 and 2019-20 seasons: 

- https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2017-2018.htm 
- https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2019-2020.html 


Recall that with the above published end-of-season summary estimates, the 
hospitalization burden is corrected for underreporting and should not be used 
for direct estimation of hospitalizations reported to HHS Protect. Using the age 
distribution of estimated hospitalizations provided in the above links is fine, as 
is using the age distribution reported in FluSurv-NET. FluSurv-NET is an influenza 
hospitalization surveillance network that collects data on laboratory-confirmed 
influenza-associated hospitalizations through a network of acute care hospitals in 
a subset of states (14 as of August 2023). Age-specific weekly rates per 100,000 
population are reported in this system. State population sizes can be used to 
approximate hospital admission counts based on the observed rates. Additional 
details on interpreting FluSurv-NET data are available at 
https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/influenza-hospitalization-surveillance.htm  


The source of age distribution used for calibration (FluSurv-NET vs summary 
end-of-season CDC estimates) should be provided in the abstract meta-data.

See hospitalization curves below for reference (2019-20, 2017-18, FluSurvnet data).

<img src= "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/main/previous-rounds/hosp_curves.png">


**Assumptions regarding vaccine effectiveness:** We will use an all-age VE of 
**40% against medically attended influenza illnesses and hospitalizations**, 
in line with what was reported for the 2017-18 and 2019-20 exemplar seasons. 
Teams who have developed age-stratified models can use the age-specific VE 
reported for these two seasons. Notably, the VE for the 2019-20 seasons 
(A/H1N1-dominated season, scenarios B, D) is stable across all age groups, while 
the VE for the 2017-18 season (A/H3N2-season, scenarios A, C) has a steep drop 
with increasing age.

- https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/2017-2018.html
- https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/2019-2020.html

We assume that VE against hospitalizations and medical illnesses is the same. 
These 2019-20 and 2017-18 VE estimates should be considered as directly 
applicable to the 2023-24 season, even though the exact mix of circulating 
subtypes (particularly how much flu B may circulate) may differ.  
As previously, assumptions about VE against infection and transmission are at 
teams’ discretion.

**Vaccine coverage assumptions:** We have provided weekly state-level coverage 
to use in scenarios A-F [here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd4_datasets/Age_Specific_Coverage_Flu_RD4_2023_24_Sc_A_B_C_D_E_F.csv) 
for age groups: 0-4yr, 5-12yr, 13-17yr, 0-17yr, 18-49yr, 50-64yr, 65+yr. These 
are based on vaccination rates reported in 2021-22 for business as usual scenarios 
(C, D), with 20% correction up (scenarios A, B) and down (scenarios E, F) to match 
scenario assumptions. The 20% changes have been applied to each age group and 
jurisdiction. I.e., if Alabama reported 50% coverage in age group 65+ in 2021-22, 
the assumed coverage for 2023-24 in low vaccination scenarios E and F is  50 * 0.8 = 40% 
in 2023-24. The timing of vaccination and relative differences between age groups and 
states will proceed similarly to past years, which has been taken into account in 
the vaccination file that we provide for the 2023-24 season. In summary, coverage 
data in this file can be used as is, without further adjustment. 


**TIMELINE: ROUND 4 FLU**

- **Scenarios set (no changes after):** *Friday, Aug 18, 2023*
- **Projections due:** *Tuesday, Sep 5, 2023*
- **Report finalized:** *No later than Friday, Sep 15, 2023*


### **OTHER SPECIFICATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS**

**Prior Immunity***

*   Prior immunity is at teams discretion. 

*   Prior influenza immunity is assumed to be a combination of residual immunity 
from previous infections and previous seasonal vaccinations. The exact 
specifications of prior immunity is left at the discretion of each team, and will
 depend on model specification, but we provide suggestions below. 


*   At the onset of a typical influenza season (all subtypes combined), modeling 
has been estimated that around 30-35% of the population has prior immunity 
(65-70% susceptible), the effective reproduction number ranges from 1.2-1.4, 
and the attack rate (final size) is between 8-25% 
https://www.pnas.org/doi/pdf/10.1073/pnas.1415012112. The 2009 pandemic, which was
 marked by the emergence of a new strain to which individuals under the age of 
 50 yrs were susceptible, was associated with greater transmission (cumulative 
 attack rates 32% over 2009) and decreased prior immunity compared to a regular 
 season (prior immunity in 2009 is ~25% instead of ~33%). 


*   Teams are allowed to vary prior immunity by virus subtype, age or other 
demographic characteristic, and state.


**COVID-19 Interactions**

*   No major interactions with future COVID-19 surges (immunological, social, 
behavior) should be considered in this round. 


**Influenza strains**

*   Hospitalization and death targets include the impact of all influenza 
subtypes combined. Influenza A/H3N2 is presumed to dominate in scenarios A, 
C, E and A/H1N1 in scenarios B, D, F. Weekly surveillance updates can be 
found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm).


*   Subtype-specific models are allowed, for instance some amount of flu B 
is allowed.
    *   Disease burden and age distribution conditions should be applied to 
    all subtypes/strains that aggregates to the overall conditions specified 
    in the scenarios


*   Intrinsic transmissibility (R0): We assume the intrinsic transmissibility 
of H3N2 is same no matter the season, and the only changes in effective 
transmission of H3N2 between years come from differences in prior immunity 
and social mixing. The same logic applies to A/H1N1. 


**Vaccine immune waning**

*   Vaccine-induced immunity has been found to decrease rapidly over the 
course of an influenza season 
https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/64/5/544/2758477?login=true

**Age groups**

*   Age-stratification is optional. If stratified, immunity, disease burden, 
and vaccination should aggregate to specifications in scenarios

*   Suggested age-strata:
    *  0-4, 5-17, 18-49, 50-64, and 65+ (or some aggregation of this, l
    ike 18-64, etc.). Most of the burden on hospitalization and deaths come f
    rom the 0-4 and 65+ age groups.


**Projection period** 

*    Sun Sep 3, 2023 to Sat June 1, 2024 (39 weeks)


**Targets:** 


In this round, we will **require submission of 100 individual trajectories 
for each target** while **submission of quantiles is optional**. As a result, 
the only required targets for trajectories will be weekly incident 
hospitalizations and weekly deaths. Estimates of cumulative counts can be 
obtained from weekly trajectories and hence we do not require trajectories for 
cumulative counts. Similarly peak targets (peak hospitalization magnitude and 
peak timing) can be reconstructed from weekly trajectories. Teams who wish to 
submit quantiles along with trajectories should provide quantiles for weekly 
and cumulative counts, as well as for hospitalization peak size and peak timing. 


*   **Weekly target**
    *   Weekly <u>reported</u> state-level incident hospitalizations, based on 
    HHS COVID and flu [reporting system](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). This dataset 
    is updated daily and covers 2020-2023. Weekly hospitalizations should be 
    based on the “previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed” variable, without 
    any adjustment for reporting (=raw data from HHS dataset to be projected). 
    A current version of the weekly aggregated data has been posted 
    [here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd1_datasets/HHS_flu_2020_2022_dataset.csv)

    *   Weekly national incident deaths, from the CDC multiplier model (i.e., 
    true mortality burden from the pyramid). These are real-time model estimates 
    updated weekly during the influenza season. The model relies on influenza 
    deaths reported in the hospitals via the FluSurv-NET system, adjusted for under 
    testing of flu in the hospital and the proportion of deaths occurring outside 
    of the hospital. There is no state detail. Preliminary estimates from the CDC 
    burden model suggest that between October 1, 2022 - April 30, 2023, between 
    19,000 – 58,000 deaths were due to flu illness or flu-related complications. 
    We have provided 3 historical seasons of weekly death estimates 
    for calibration](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd1_datasets/In-season-National-Burden.csv). 
    Further, see [here](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/preliminary-in-season-estimates.htm) 
    for real-time cumulative estimates, and summary estimates for past seasons. 
    A file of weekly cumulative estimates for the 2022-23 season is posted [here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/CumulativeDeath/In_season_CDC_burden_estimates_deaths.csv).

    * No case target

    * No infection target   

    * All targets should be numbers of individuals, rather than rates.


*   **Optional targets (only if submitting quantiles in addition to trajectories):**
    * Cumulative hospitalizations. Cumulative outcomes start at 0 at the start of projections, on Sep 3, 2023. This is similar to rounds 1-3. 
    * State-level peak hospitalizations.
    * State-level timing of peak hospitalizations


**State-level variability**

*   Vaccination coverage, age population. Variability in the age distribution of hospitalizations between states is allowed as long as it aggregates to the scenario definition for the US overall (population weighted average). 

*   Variability in severity between states is possible

*   Prior immunity (due to a combination of vaccination and natural infection) can be the same or vary between states.


**Cross-protection of subtype immunity:** At the discretion of the teams.


**Seasonality:** Teams should include their best estimates of influenza seasonality 
in their model but we do not prescribe a specific level of seasonal forcing.


**NPI:** No reactive NPIs to COVID-19 or influenza; low level masking allowed at 
groups’ discretion.


**Seeding of influenza:** We leave seeding intensity, timing and geographic 
distribution at the discretion of the teams. In addition to the HHS hospital dataset, 
the [flu portal dashboard](https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/fluportaldashboard.html) 
is a good resource for state-specific information on strain circulation and epidemic 
intensity (eg, weekly % positive, or weekly ILI * % positive), and can be used to 
adjust seeding.


**Initial Conditions:**  The mix of circulating strains at the start of the projection 
period is at the discretion of the teams based on their interpretation of the 
scenarios. Variation in initial prevalence between states is left at teams’ discretion. 

 
**All of the teams’ specific assumptions should be documented in metadata and 
abstract.**

**Other submission requirements**

*   **Simulation trajectories:** We ask that teams submit a sample of up to 100 
simulation replicates. Simulations should be sampled in such a way that they will 
be most likely to produce the same summary statistics as that quantile submitted. 
For some models, this may mean a random sample of simulations, for others with 
arger numbers of simulations, it may require weighted sampling.

*   **Geographic scope:** state-level and national projections
    *    All states not required, US overall recommended.

*   **Results:**
    *  Summary: Results must consist of a subset of weekly targets listed below; all 
    are not required. Weeks follow epi-weeks (Sun-Sat) dated by the last day of the week. 

    *  **Weekly Targets** (subset of: hospitalizations, deaths)
        *    Weekly incident 

*   **Metadata:** We will require a brief meta-data form, from all teams.

*   **Uncertainty:**
    *  For trajectories (required submission): we require 100 trajectories.
    *  For quantiles (optional submission): we ask for 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, every 
    5% to 0.95, 0.975, and 0.99. Teams are also encouraged to submit 0 (min value) 
    and 1 (max) quantiles if possible. 


## More details on target:

### Hospital target:

*   We use the [
HHS COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh). 
The target to be  projected is confirmed influenza hospital admissions, reported as 
*previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed*. Therefore, before aggregating to 
the weekly values, the gold standard or “truth” data will shift the values in the 
date column one day earlier so that the date aligns with the date of admission. As 
an example, if 17 confirmed influenza hospital admissions were reported in the 
`previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed` field in a row where the `date field` 
was 2021-10-30, then the “truth” dataset would assign those 17 hospital admissions 
to a date of 2021-10-29. These cases would then be counted towards the weekly total 
computed for EW43, which runs from 2021-10-24 through 2021-10-30.

*   Influenza admission reporting became mandatory in this dataset on Feb-02-2021,
 and should continue to be mandatory for the duration of the summer and into the 
 next flu season. Accordingly, more than 41,000 US hospitals are reporting flu on 
 a weekly basis and no adjustment for reporting changes should be made. However the 
 data before Feb-02-2021 should be treated with caution.

*   Unlike flu admissions, flu deaths are no longer mandatory to report in this system 
and hence a different source of data will be used for deaths.

*   There is no age breakdown for flu in this HHS dataset. If teams need age-specific 
hospitalization data for calibration, or a longer dataset, they can apply the age 
distribution of flu hospitalizations available in 
[Flusurv-NET](https://gis.cdc.gov/GRASP/Fluview/FluHospRates.html) to the all-age HHS 
rate. Flusurv-NET is CDC’s parallel and long-running hospitalization 
surveillance system, which is based on a smaller set of US hospitals (9%). We have
 provided state-specific time series 
[here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/blob/main/Rd1_datasets/Flusurvnet_2003_2022_dataset.csv) (2003-present). Because Flusurv-NET data is not 
available for all states, we recommend that teams use the national age distribution of 
hospitalizations estimated in Flusurv-NET and apply it to national and state-specific 
HHS data. Adjustment for demographic differences between states can be considered, but 
are not required.

*   Earlier analyses have shown that estimates of influenza incidences are consistent 
between the HHS and CDC hospital surveillance systems in areas where both systems 
overlap. The flusurvnet data estimates ~15% fewer hospitalizations nationally 
than the HHS system based on 2021-22 data; however these differences may vary during 
the 2022-23 season.

## Submitting model projections

Groups interested in participating can submit model projections for each 
scenario in a parquet file formatted according to our specifications, and a metadata
file with a description of model information. See 
[here](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub/blob/main/data-processed/README.md) 
for technical submission requirements. Groups can submit their contributions as 
often as they want; the date of when a model projection was made (projection 
date) is recorded in the model submission file.   

### Gold standard data

For Flu hospitalizations, we use the [HHS COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/qqte-vkut). The target to be projected is confirmed influenza hospital admissions, reported as `"previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed"`. Therefore, before aggregating to the weekly values, the gold standard or “truth” data will shift the values in the date column one day earlier so that the date aligns with the date of admission. As an example, if 17 confirmed influenza hospital admissions were reported in the `"previous_day_admission_influenza_confirmed"` field in a row where the `date field` was 2021-10-30, then the “truth” dataset would assign those 17 hospital admissions to a date of 2021-10-29. These cases would then be counted towards the weekly total computed for EW43, which runs from 2021-10-24 through 2021-10-30.

For Flu death, we use weekly estimates of cumulative influenza-related deaths based on CDC multiplier model, the data are available in the [flu-scenario-modeling-resources](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources) GitHub repository in the [CumulativeDeath](https://github.com/midas-network/flu-scenario-modeling-hub_resources/tree/main/CumulativeDeath) folder. The model is based on in-hospital deaths reported to flusurvnet and accounts for lack of influenza testing in the hospital, and deaths occurring outside of the hospital system. Estimates provided in this file are the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles (95% uncertainty interval). 

## Ensemble model
We aim to combine model projections into an ensemble.
